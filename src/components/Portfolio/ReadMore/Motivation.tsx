        This application is composed of two apps, the tic-tac-toe game and a
        To-Do-List app.
        <br /><br /> The two apps look unrelated this is because this is the first
        application that I have built. My goal was to learn the basics of the
        back-end and front-end development. So I started first by creating a
        To-Do-List app and then after succesfully building it and to enhance my
        skills and my understanding of the concepts, I started with a harder
        project, which is the Tic-Tac-Toe game. <br /><br /> Then to learn the concept
        of Routing, I merged the two projects into one project.
        <br /><br /> Just by building these two applications, I learned the core
        concepts of front-end like: Making CRUD operations, understanding React
        principles, managing the state of the app using Redux library, and much
        more..
        <br /><br /> In the app I also managed the back-end part and understood its
        basic concepts. For both apps, user&apos;s data is saved in a database,
        so your information will not get lost when you exit the page. You can
        register and log-in with your credentials, or you can just sign-in with
        your GitHuB account.{" "}
