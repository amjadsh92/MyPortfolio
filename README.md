# Project Title

My Portfolio Project

# Motivation

While learing web-developemnt, I discovered that I am more attached to the front-end world. I decided to go deeply further in this field. As a fist step, I built this portfolio application to enhance my skills in this domain. I used Nextjs 14 (App router) with leveraging Typescript and Tailwind css.

# Project Description

It is a standard portfolio. In the home page, you can read a short summery about my profile, then you can navigate to my CV, Portfolio, and the Publications and Documents page.


# Installtion

Just after cloning the repositiory use this command

    npm i

to install all necessary modules.


That's it. I hope you like the project!
